## Introduction
## Business overview
Safana Telecoms is among the leading company in Syria that provides telecommunication services in the country. Telecommunication industry is a fast growing economic sector that actors keep track of the fast paced technological advancement in the industry. As a result of this change, Safana has faced a sisginificant challenge of customer churning and wants to understand the cause of this change.

## Problem Statement
Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company or stop using its products or services. Understanding the factors that contribute to churn is crucial for businesses to retain customers and maintain long-term profitability. This project will focus on identifying patterns in customers behaviour that will idenitfly predictable patterns in customer behavoiurs and predict which customers are more likely to churn the company.



## Objectives
This projects aims to create a classification model that determine customer churning

To dentifly features to help retain customer.

The notebook covers the following key steps:

•	Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset and perform initial exploration to understand its structure, feature types, and any missing values.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct an in-depth analysis of the dataset, including visualizations and statistical summaries, to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between variables.
•	Predictive Modeling: Build predictive models using machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn and measure their performance.
•	Model Evaluation: measure the performance of diffrent models to evalute their effectiveness on prediciting on unseen data.
•	Model Interpretation and Insights: Analyze the model results, and coefficients to extract meaningful insights and actionable recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
Throughout the notebook, code snippets, visualizations, and explanations will be provided to guide the analysis process.
